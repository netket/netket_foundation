    This function behaves like :attr:`~netket.vqs.MCState.samples`, also sampling its
    output values, but it allows to specify a distribution different from the wavefunction
    itself.

    This is used mainly for the sampling of the :math:`H\\log\\psi` and a target distribution with
    the infidelity sampler, but can also be used to build importance sampling.

    By default, with no arguments, this behaves as :attr:`~netket.vqs.MCState.samples`.

    .. note::

        The sampler state for those distributions are stored in the MCState in the attribute
        `sampler_states`. The samples are stored in the attribute `_samples_distributions`,
        the resampling cache in `_samples_distribution_resampling_cache`.

    Args:
        distribution: The distribution to sample from. This must be a flax Module or
            a Callable with the standard structure. If None, the model of the state is used.
        variables: The variables to sample from. If None, the variables of the model are used
        seed: The seed for the random number generator to be used if the sampler must be
            initialized. It's ignored otherwise.
        chain_length: The length of the chain to sample. If None, the value set internally
            is used. If n_samples is set, this is computed from n_samples. If resample_fraction
            is set, the actual chain length will be :math:`\text{chain_length} \times \text{resample_fraction}`.
        resample_fraction: The fraction of the chain to resample. If None, the value set
            internally is used. If 0, only 1 sample per chain is resampled. Effectively this
            reduces the number of samples to be generated, while returning always the
